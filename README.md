# To-Do Now 📝

[**To-Do Now**](https://mohamed-man.github.io/ToDoList-WebApp/) is a simple and functional to-do list application created as my first JavaScript excercise. The app allows users to add, edit, mark as done, and delete tasks. This project demonstrates my ability to work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and `localStorage` for data persistence.

## About the Design
The design of this project was inspired by [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1234925437659671587/to-do-list). I converted the design into **HTML** and **CSS**, and then implemented the **JavaScript** functionality to make the app interactive and dynamic.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.  
2. Start managing your tasks:  
   - Type a task in the input field.  
   - Click **Add Task** or press **Enter** to add it to the list.  
   - Use the **✔️ Done**, **✏️ Edit**, and **🗑️ Delete** buttons to manage tasks.
